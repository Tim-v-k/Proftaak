            <h4> We are a team of 5 people, we are studying in the first year of our course. <br> The course is 3 years long, we got the task to make a prof task. 
            <br> We discussed and came to a project named "Gaming Zone", its a website(webshop) where we sell multiple gaming gear and games. <br>
            In addition to competitive prices, we find service the most important. Who wouldn't want a quick response to emails, a pleasant return arrangement, when a product breaks down a quick solution or just as quickly ask a question via Social Media? <br>
             That is why we are committed as much as possible to offer fast and correct service, whereby you feel valued as a customer. <br>
             The service is also reflected in the ratings that customers give us on Budget gaming or Trustpilot, for example, which does us very well and motivates us to maintain and even improve this service in the coming years.
